// Day-59 of 100-Days-Of-Code Challenge
// Day-59 Task:
// Read the following Articles and Code along with it:
// Loops: while and for in JavaScript
// The "switch" statement in JavaScript
// Loops: while and for
// We often need to repeat actions.
// For example, outputting goods from a list one after another or just running the same code for each number from 1 to 10.
// Loops are a way to repeat the same code multiple times.
// The "switch" statement
// A switch statement can replace multiple if checks.
// It gives a more descriptive way to compare a value with multiple variants.
// The syntax
// The switch has one or more case blocks and an optional default.
