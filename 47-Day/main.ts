// Question 139: List three reserved words in JavaScript and create a valid use case for each.

// Explain & TIP: Reserved words in JavaScript are words that have a special meaning and cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names). Understanding these can help prevent syntax errors and make your code more readable.


let a : number = 15 ;
if (a > 0){console.log("A is greater than 0.")};





// Reserved word: return - used to exit a function and return a value from that function
// function add(a, b) {
//     return a + b;
//   }
  
  // Demonstrates valid use cases for the reserved words 'let', 'if', and 'return'.











//   Question 140: Explain the error that occurs when trying to use a reserved word as a variable name.

//   Explain & TIP: Attempting to use a reserved word as a variable name will cause a syntax error in JavaScript. This is because reserved words have predefined meanings and uses in the language syntax.

// Attempting to use a reserved word as a variable name
// let if = 5; // This line would cause a syntax error

console.log(
    "Using a reserved word as a variable name causes a syntax error in JavaScript."
  );
  // It's important to avoid using reserved words as identifiers to prevent these errors.










//   Question 141: Discuss the significance of the await reserved word in asynchronous JavaScript.

// Explain & TIP: The await operator is used to wait for a Promise to settle. It can only be used inside an async function. Using await makes asynchronous code look and behave a little more like synchronous code, which can make it easier to understand and debug.

// Example use of the 'await' reserved word in asynchronous JavaScript
async function fetchData() {
    // Assuming fetchSomething returns a Promise
    const data = await fetchSomething();
    console.log(data);
    // The 'await' keyword pauses the execution until the Promise settles, and then resumes with the resolved value.
  }
  
  console.log(
    "The 'await' keyword allows asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner, more linear fashion."
  );
  // This demonstrates how 'await' improves readability and flow in asynchronous code.
