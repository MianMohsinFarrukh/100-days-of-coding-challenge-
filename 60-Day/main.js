// Day-60 of 100-Days-Of-Code Challenge
// Day-60 Task:
// Read the following Articles and Code along with it:
// Functions in JavaScript
// Function Expressions in JavaScript
// Functions
// Quite often we need to perform a similar action in many places of the script.
// For example, we need to show a nice-looking message when a visitor logs in, logs out and maybe somewhere else.
// Functions are the main “building blocks” of the program. They allow the code to be called many times without repetition.
// Function expressions
// In JavaScript, a function is not a “magical language structure”, but a special kind of value.
// The syntax that we used before is called a Function Declaration:
// function sayHi() {
//   alert( "Hello" );
// }
// There is another syntax for creating a function that is called a Function Expression.
// It allows us to create a new function in the middle of any expression.
